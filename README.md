# Calico

## Introduction
This project focuses on improving 3D print quality by drying filament and keeping it at an optimal temperature. It ensures consistent and reliable printing performance, particularly with moisture-sensitive materials â€” a goal that this device effectively achieves.

## Features
- **Filament Drying:** Removes moisture to prevent print defects.
- **Temperature Regulation:** Maintains optimal filament temperature for better flow and adhesion.
- **Improved 3D Print Quality:** Ensures consistent results, even with challenging materials.
